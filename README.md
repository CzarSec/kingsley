## About Me
My professional journey began in creative and administrative roles working as a Graphic Designer and Virtual Assistant. These experiences sharpened my eye for detail, strengthened my problem-solving skills, and taught me how to manage time-critical tasks, all of which laid a solid foundation for my transition into the fast-paced world of cybersecurity.

Driven by a desire to take my career a step further, I pivoted into cybersecurity, where I now focus on defending organizations against threat actors and safeguarding critical systems from cyberattacks. I’m currently building deep expertise in Security Operations (SOC) with a particular focus on Incident Response, threat detection, and alert triage.
My work focuses on deploying and managing SIEM solutions that help organizations monitor their environments and defend against threats. I also apply OSINT techniques as a Cyber Threat Intelligence analyst to identify cues that could pose risks to businesses.

As a SOC Analyst, I configure tools that collect and analyze aggregated logs, which guide my response actions. I rely on monitoring platforms to discover potential threats, investigate them, and provide timely reports to the appropriate stakeholders.

Here are some of the tools I use regularly:

**Wazuh:** My preferred SIEM solution for detecting threats on endpoints and cloud servers, and for taking real-time action through its active response feature.
**Graylog:** Useful for collecting and centralizing logs from multiple devices.
**Wireshark:** Helps me inspect and analyze network packets.
**Spiderfoot:** Supports reconnaissance for identifying points of interest during investigations.
